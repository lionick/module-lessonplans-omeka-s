# Lesson Plans
Create Lesson Plans with the power of items' functionality.
Lesson Plans are actually items having their own custom configuration.

## Installation
See general end user documentation for [Installing a module](http://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/#installing-modules)

## Configuration
Each site can have its own configuration for Lesson Plans:

* Default Item Set: You can set the default Item Set, the created Lesson Plan will belong to. When adding a Lesson Plan, Item Set section will have the default value you choose.
* Default Resource Template: You can set the default Resource Template, the created Lesson Plan will have. When adding a Lesson Plan a default Resource Template will be set and will load the relative fields.
* Default Property for Indexer: You can set a property that will copy the dc:title on the fly. This option, is designed for indexing reasons. As we want a unique field for storing information that is relative only to Lesson Plans.
